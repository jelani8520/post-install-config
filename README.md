  Opening a new ticket in a ticketing system is a crucial process for reporting issues, requesting support, or tracking service requests. To create a ticket, users typically log into the system and navigate to the “New Ticket” or “Create Request” section. They are required to provide essential details such as the issue type, priority level, a clear description of the problem, and any relevant attachments or screenshots. Some ticketing systems also allow users to categorize the request and assign it to the appropriate department. ive wokred on making tickets and asign them to different departments
