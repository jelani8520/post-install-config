 When responding to an SLA ticket,i as a agent acknowledged the issue within the agreed response time. Then provide updates, request additional details if needed, and work towards a resolution while ensuring compliance with the SLA terms. Regular communication keeps the user informed about progress.
Once the issue is resolved, the agent marks the ticket as resolved or closed,</p>
